This project focuses on building a predictive model to determine whether a person is likely to develop diabetes. 
The analysis begins with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), employing libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize the data, detect outliers, and understand feature distributions. 
Data preprocessing includes handling categorical variables using label encoding and scaling numerical features with StandardScaler to ensure uniformity.
The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier is utilized for model training, with careful hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance.
Finally, train and test scores are visualized to evaluate the model's accuracy and overall effectiveness. 
This comprehensive workflow demonstrates a structured approach to data preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation in predictive analytics.
